File Structure:

First_File_To_Run.R
	This file contains code that will store data files and code files location into variables that will be used in remaining files to set the working directories.

Load_Data.R
	This file contains code that will load and sample the training data, split that dataset into training and validation datasets.(70%, 30%)

ROCPlot.R
	This file contains code for creating ROCPlots.

Execution_Sequence.R
	This file runs all the code till testing models and selecting one.

Shrink_Categories_and_Factor.R
	This file will shrink the number of categories to max categories allowed in one variable(max categories is 50 in our project)

transform_time_variables.R
	This file transforms the time varible 'hour' in our project. We have split it in is_week_day and hour of the day variable.

Matching Levels.R
	This file contains sample code for matching the levels in training and test data.

Final_Load_Data.R
	This file runs all the code for selected model to run on testdata and writes the probabilities and classes to csv files

Lasso Regression.R
	This file contains all the code for running lasso regression.

transform_time_variables.R(Incomplete code)
	We tried to use H2O framework for performance tuning but could not get it running.
